# Basic Reddit Scrape

A Python 3.6 script that uses PRAW to retrieve data on submissions made to the 'jokes' subreddit. 

It can be easily edited to collect data from other subreddits.

For a detailed guide on using the script visit [my blog](https://benjaminturpin.wordpress.com/2017/08/02/intro-to-web-scraping-reddit-with-python/).
